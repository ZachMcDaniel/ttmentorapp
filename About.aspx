        <p>Business Analytics and Information Systems Major. Hi I’m Noah and I will be the Director of Marketing in Tippie tech this year. I’ve been in Tippie tech for a year and believe this role suits me because I have a passion for technology and building a brand. I am a video editor and animator in my spare time. I’m a huge nerd who plays way too many video games and watches movies as much as I can. I’ve played every sport imaginable and I can also juggle. </p>

        <p>Business Analytics and Accounting Major.  I joined Tippie Tech last semester to meet and collaborate with students in the Business Analytics major. My favorite part about this organization is the mutual passion members have for learning about and networking with companies. This organization has shown a strong initiative to help its members reach their goals. Some other organizations that I am involved in within Tippie include Alpha Kappa Psi Business Fraternity, Hawktrade, Accounting Club, and Tippie Honors Society. This summer I am serving as an Accounting Intern (virtually) at Frontier Co-Op. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions or just to talk numbers, school, life, etc. I am looking forward to being back in-person in the fall (fingers crossed) and working with you all! </p>

        <p>Business Analytics and Information Systems major.  I’ve been in Tippie Tech for a year now and I’ve loved every part of it! My favorite thing about the club is being able to listen to actual companies come in and talk with us about their operations and what makes them successful and then having the opportunity to speak with them about where I could possibly see myself with them. I am also a member of Hawk Trade Investment Club here on campus and I play on the University of Iowa Club Baseball Team. I am very excited to see what we have in store this year for Tippie Tech and I can’t wait to make it even more successful than it already has been! </p>
